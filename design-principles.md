# Design Principles

1. Encapsulate what varies
1. Program to interfaces, not implementations
1. Favor composition over inheritance
1. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
1. Classes/Code should be open for extension but closed for modification
1. Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend upon abstractions, do not depend upon concrete classes (high-level components should not depend on low-level components; rather, they should both depend on abstractions)
1. Principle of Least Knowledge/Law of Demeter: Talk only to your immediate friends
1. Hollywood Principle: Don't call us, we'll call you (high-level modules should decide how and when to call low-level modules)
1. Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change (keep each class to a single responsibility)
1. Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)
